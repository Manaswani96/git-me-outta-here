### tiny chaotic commits from a polymath-in-progress

Welcome to my public **escape portal** — a tiny place where I log:
- micro-progress  
- toy experiments  
- philosophical chaos  
- tiny scripts  
- polymath energy  
- accidental wisdom  
- and proof that I still exist 🔥  

I don’t share my full research or deep code here  
(THAT lives in my secret labs 🧪💀)  
but I *do* share the journey, the vibes, and the tiny wins.

This repo is:
- ✨ a motivation engine

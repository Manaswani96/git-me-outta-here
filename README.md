# ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*  git-me-outta-here  *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧  
A small space where I drop tiny commits, chaotic experiments, mini scripts, and whatever my brain cooks at 2AM.

Not deep code.  
Not secret research.  
Just vibes, progress, and fun.

## 🤝 Contributing (Chaos-Friendly Mode)
You *can* contribute — but with rules:

- Don’t touch my main files (I guard them with love ❤️).  
- Add your chaos ONLY inside:  
  `contributors/<your-name>/`  
- Keep it fun, tiny, weird, or philosophical.  
- No negativity, no drama, no “real code wars.”  

**Examples:**  
`contributors/alice/thought.md`  
`contributors/bob/my-chaotic-day.txt`

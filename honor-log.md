## 🛡️ Respect Over Ridicule — The Tejas Crash

A pilot lost his life flying the Tejas at the Dubai Air Show.

He performed high-skill manoeuvres.  
He represented the country.  
He took the risk.  
He paid the price.

Mocking him or calling the aircraft “bad” isn’t funny — it’s ignorant.

If you’ve never flown a jet,  
never sat in a cockpit,  
never faced a split-second life-or-death decision,  

then the minimum contribution you can make is **respect.**

Mistakes happen in aviation.  
Risks exist in every mission.  
He didn’t walk away — because walking away might have cost someone else their life.

That’s not weakness.  
That’s courage.

If you can’t fight,  
If you can’t fly,  
If you can’t serve,  

then **don’t mock those who do.**

Silence is better than disrespect.

Respect the uniform.  
Respect the sacrifice.  
Respect the man who didn’t come home.
Respect isn’t a favour. It’s the bare minimum!!
Heroes don’t get to tweet about their bravery. They just pay the price!!!

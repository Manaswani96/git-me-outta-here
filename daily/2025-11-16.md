## ⚔️ What I conquered today
- 🧠 **Operating Systems coursework** — because apparently my “process management” is better than my real-life management
- 🤖 **Machine Learning practice** — fed a model some data and *it didn’t cry*, so that counts as success
- 🌋 **Quantumm research** — still bending physics with quantum neural nets like it’s casual wizardry
- 🛰️ **Landmine Detection reading** — because saving lives and breaking models go hand in hand
- 🔥 **Studied anger control** — learned that *not* flipping tables is an advanced OS scheduling algorithm

## 🌪️ One-line summary
> I multitasked like an entire research lab with caffeine issues (hopefully!!).

## 🧬 Tiny Brain Dump
- My mind: *“Let’s be calm.”*  
  Also my mind: *“Let’s train quantum PINNs and blow up gradients.”*
- Landmines are scary. My brain is scarier.
- If operating systems can handle deadlocks, so can I (Exam stressy 🔪).

## Summary
Not a peak day — just a soft winter chapter.  
A little research, a little physics, a random bio exam, and one more exam left till this semester retires.  
Mood: chilled but trying.

## Academic Blur
- Did some light research (quiet progress, nothing dramatic)
- Touched a bit of physics to keep the spark alive
- Survived a bio exam — not my favorite, but whatever
- Final exam of the sem coming up… almost at the finish line
## Math Brain Moments
At one point today:
- I felt like Einstein  
and two minutes later:
- I questioned whether my brain was made of clouds or cotton

## Winter Productivity Mode
Winter makes everything slower.  
But I showed up anyway!

Tiny effort > no effort.

Speed is hitting 85 wpm —  
accuracy still needs adult supervision.  

## Today’s Vibe Check
A mix of:
- effort  
- laziness  
- curiosity  
- winter coziness  

Basically: functional chaos.

## Signing Off!
Mental upgrade complete. Monkey exhausted. Future loading. Byeee!!

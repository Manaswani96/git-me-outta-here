## Summary
A full-stack upgrade day.
New tools, new environments, new confidence.
Less procrastination. More action.

## ⚙️ System Log
- Switched across different tools & environments without panic
- Practiced Python + applied what I learned (exam hai tmrrr)
- Touched some ML concepts & hands-on bits
- No research today (apparently Sundays are “brain maintenance mode”)
- Worked out — body update patch installed
- Money saved instead of spent (maturity.exe unlocked)

## Personal Insight
Adapting > Avoiding.  
Every time I choose action over procrastination, my future gets lighter.

## 🛡️ Pride Check
Thinking about our Armed Forces hit hard today.  
Sadness, yes — but also massive respect.

Some names India should never forget:
- Captain Vikram Batra (Kargil)
- Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan (26/11)
- Lance Naik Hanumanthappa (Siachen)
- Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja (Kargil)

They didn’t talk about courage.  
They lived it.

##  Adulting Log
Had money.  
Could’ve spent it.  
Didn’t.  
Peak “responsible human” moment.
Even sounded like my mom for 3 seconds.

## 🎭 Today’s Realization
Strength isn’t loud.
It’s the quiet choice to stay disciplined when no one’s watching.

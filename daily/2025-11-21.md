## 🌌 Summary
Jumped from quantum to cosmology like I'm cheating on my own research pipeline.  
Read books. Watched a scary movie.  
Turns out I'm scarier than the ghost.

Today was a strange mix of wasted time + valuable insights.

## ⚙️ System Log
- Switched from quantum mechanics to cosmology (my brain filed a complaint).
- Wasted time chatting even though I KNEW I would regret it. Classic.
- Read insanely good books — Feynman feels like he’s literally beside me talking.
- Learned more from Warren Buffett than any “self-help guru” combined.
- Realized I love doing both theory + experiments. Keeps me sane.
- Worked on research (quiet progress).

## 🧩 Life Upgrades of the Day
- If people judge you from the outside, let them.  
  You’re busy upgrading the inside. That’s where the real power is.

- Stop waiting to “feel ready.”  
  Move. Act. Build. Confidence comes from motion, not thinking.

- You can fail ten times, a hundred times — doesn’t matter.  
  What matters is that the next version of you is always stronger.

- Nobody owes you support.  
- No one owes you anything.
  And that’s your biggest advantage — because you build without permission.

- All defeat is psychological until death.  
  Everything else is recoverable.

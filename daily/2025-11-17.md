## ☄️ Summary
Studied *a bit too many* things and somehow ended up creating cosmic simulations like it's a casual Tuesday.

## ⚙️ System Log
- Played with thermodynamics because why not melt my brain.
- Looked at ML coursework.
- Accidentally wandered into cosmos code.
- Winter vibes + low sleep = aesthetic chaos.
